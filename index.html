WebSTUMP is a user interface for STUMP and Gatekeeper users. It gives
moderators an easy and universally accessible Web interface through which
they can moderate newsgroups. Use of WebSTUMP requires NO computer
skills beyond  knowing how to operate a Web browser.<P>

The demo pages give you an opportunity to "test drive" STUMP. They
are not functional in the sense that your actions do not affect anyone.
However, they do give you a "look and feel" of how WebSTUMP interface
looks to moderators.<P>

On the next page, click on a newsgroup name to begin. Try clicking on
various links and buttons and see what happens.<P>
