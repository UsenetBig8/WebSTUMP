Untrusted subjects list is the list of subjects
which should always be reviewed by mods, even if the messages are posted by 
preapproved posters.<P>

Example:<P>

<PRE>
abortion
gun control
forger
</PRE>

The above would ensure that all discussions with Subject: containing one
of the above words would be monitored. A nice way to deal with
controversial topics or flames.
