Banned words list is the list of fragments of articles which you would
like to permanently bar from your newsgroup. For example, if you
never want articles mentioning 1-900 anywhere, you would put 1-900
into that list.<P>

It can be a list like this<P>

<PRE>
1-900
make money fast
XXX
</PRE>

That means that no message containing words 1-900, "make money fast",
and "xxx" will ever be posted.<P>

Of course, populating this list is a matter of your policy. However, I
want to warn new moderators that banning words would also have
the effect of preventing meta-discussions. For instance, someone
suggesting that 1-900 should now be discussed would not be able to
post this suggestion.
