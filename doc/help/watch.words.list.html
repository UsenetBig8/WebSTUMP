List of words to watch is the list of text patterns 
which, if they appear in a message, should ensure that the message is
not automatically approved and is stored in WebSTUMP for human review.<P>

These words may be an indication of a potential spam, or a flame
etc. Perhaps, for many groups, putting common profanities, as well
as things like XXX and 1-900, is a good strategy. Note however, that
there is generally no reason to forbid the use of profanity, as such.<P>

Example:<P>

<PRE>
happy99.exe
fuck
shit
cunt
XXX
1-900
1-800
make money fast
</PRE>

My advice is to watch your group for patterns appearing in offtopic posts,
and use them to your advantage to help you with filtering.
